# nemsqar 1.2.1
- Updated how wrapper functions report runtime (e.g., `airway_01()`). Runtime is
  now calculated using `difftime(units = "auto")`, converting the result with
  `as.numeric()` and extracting the dynamic time unit via 
  `attr(which = "units")`. This makes the time unit automatic and avoids
  potential downstream issues.  
- Corrected a typo involving ETCO2 across several functions, `globalVariables.R`,
  and `constants.R`, where it appeared as “etc02” in various cases. All instances
  were fixed by replacing the zero with the letter “o” (case‑sensitive). 

# nemsqar 1.2.0
- Update `trauma_04_population()` to look to the facility ID instead of the
  hospital capabilities for performance measurement. This is a breaking change
  but will make the measure more accurate. This change comes as part of the
  NEMSQA Measure Development committee has discussed this action seeing dismal
  national performance on this measure.
- Added the new function `nemsqa_missing_summary()` to summarize missing data
  within each `*_popoulation()` function and to be included in the `list` object
  returned by the same functions.
- Added the first `nemsqar` vignette! Please use `vignette(topic = "nemsqar",
  package = "nemsqar")` to check it out.
- Added tests for `validate_set()`, `validate_numeric()` tests were improved,
  `validate_names()`, added tests for `validate_length()` and
  `compare_formals()`. 
- Removed documentation for the `validate_*()` family of functions and use
  keyword internal in their documentation. 
- `results_summarize()` and `summarize_measure()` no longer have external facing
  documentation and are internal. 
- Added a contributor's code of conduct.
- Removed some language giving thanks to early contributors from the README file
  and placed that in the initial release of `nemsqar`.
- Implemented `usethis::use_tidy_*` package helpers to clean up various parts of
  the package such as workflows and using `Air` as the code formatter
  throughout.

# nemsqar 1.1.4
* Documentation using @inheritParams to help with making functions more
  maintainable.
* Update regex within each function so they utilize paste() to make the regex
  more maintainable.
* Created `constants.R` to contain all regex for the package as internal to the
  package. `constants.R` is loaded at package install / load and these regex
  objects are available to the package for the functions to reference.
* Put regex (be sensitive to measure-specific regex) into .R/constants.R file to
  centralize these and functions just reference these objects. Then, we can
  delete all regex within functions for an even easier time maintaining the
  package. This addresses issue #22.
* Update data validation where applicable to use functional validation.
* Abbreviate the code base by removing separate workflows for the 'df' and
  'table' data sources. Unify these by always ending up with 'tables' by
  splitting up a 'df' if supplied, and then only needing to proceed with major
  data validation and the analysis on objects named like `*_table`. 
* Replace data validation that involve rlang::as_name(quo) with making this code
  more readable by creating a separate `*_name` object for applicable columns
  and then running validation on `object[[name]]`.

# nemsqar 1.1.3
- Added navigation to all major functions in the package. This was done by
  adding `----` to the end of most comments.
- Some functions received code formatting due to the addition of the `----` or
  just by virtue of editing the script, the `Air` package does the formatting
  via Positron.
- Improved comments in the code in some functions and removed one code
  redundancy in a function that performed the exact same check that the
  `*_table` and `df` arguments were receiving inputs simulataneously.

# nemsqar 1.1.2

- Fixed broken URLs in the documentation for `nemsqa_binomial_confint()`.

# nemsqar 1.1.1

- In `airway_01_population()`, the filter_process object had one text descriptor `"All initial population successful intubation with no hypoxia or hypoxia/hypotension"`
which was corrected to be `"All initial population successful intubation with no hypoxia/hypotension"`.

- Also, in `trauma_14_population()`, the `filter_process` object has one text descriptor `"Tournique procedure"` which was corrected to be `"Tourniquet procedure"`.

- Additionally, trauma_14_population() should *just work* after passing an arbitrary number of (applicable) columns to the `transport_disposition` argument. In {nemsqar} 1.1.0, only one column will work as the `grepl()` call is not wrapped in `dpyr::if_any()`. This was fixed so that users can reference other columns that contain transport disposition data, such as eDisposition.12 from NEMSIS 3.4 (or earlier versions as applicable). This helps with back compatibility when using this measure to earlier versions of NEMSIS, or later versions.

# nemsqar 1.1.0  

## Enhancements  

- **Optional Confidence Intervals**: Added the ability to compute confidence intervals using the Wilson or Clopper-Pearson (exact) method. This feature is optional and can be enabled when working with sample data.
  - Introduced `nemsqa_binomial_confint()`, a lightweight wrapper around `prop.test()` and `binom.test()` for calculating Wilson and exact confidence intervals. This function eliminates the need for an additional package dependency.
    * Ensure warning messages where any `denominator` < 10 are elegant and helpful, and `nemsqa_binomial_confit()` handles division by zero cases well.
  - Updated all wrapper functions (e.g., `airway_01()`) to support optional confidence interval calculation.
  - Maintained full backward compatibility with **nemsqar 1.0.0** by setting `confidence_interval = FALSE` as the default behavior.
- **Dynamic `results_summarize()`**: Enhanced `results_summarize()` to dynamically calculate only the specified groups, utilizing the previously unused `population_labels` object. This reduces unnecessary calculations and streamlines function performance.  
- **Improved Documentation**: 
  - Updated and expanded the documentation for `results_summarize()` and `summarize_measure()`, offering clearer usage instructions and examples to enhance the user experience.
  - Refined the documentation for multiple other functions, improving clarity and usability.
