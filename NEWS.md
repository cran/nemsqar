  * Developed the functions first as including the whole process of getting the
    target population and calculating performance.

  * Adjusted the calculation of measure performance to be modular, with the
    addition of the *_population workhorse functions that do the heavy lifting
    of gathering the records from the data provided to the function needed to
    then calculate the measures.
  
  * Created the measure_## functions as wrappers to run the *_population functions
    and take those data to then calculate measure performance based on the 
    National EMS Quality Alliance (NEMSQA) measure technical documents.
