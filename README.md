`nemsqar` is an R package designed to automate the calculation of EMS
quality metrics as defined by the National EMS Quality Alliance
(NEMSQA). With a focus on enhancing EMS service performance through
reliable, evidence-based quality measures, `nemsqar` aims to streamline
metric calculation for healthcare providers, EMS agencies, and
researchers dedicated to improving patient outcomes.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `nemsqar` with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("bemts-hhs/nemsqar")
```

Additionally, you may install the current version of `nemsqar` on CRAN
via:

``` r
install.packages("nemsqar")
```

## Functionality

`nemsqar` has functions that will always automate the calculation of a
service‚Äôs performance (or even a system‚Äôs) against the currently
approved list of NEMSQA Measures (see below). Given the large number of
these functions, please check the full package documentation resource
[here](https://bemts-hhs.github.io/nemsqar/).

## About NEMSQA

The National EMS Quality Alliance (NEMSQA) is committed to developing
and endorsing quality measures that improve patient and provider
experiences within EMS and healthcare systems. Originating from the EMS
Compass Project (2014), NEMSQA has evolved as an independent
organization, tasked with completing and sustaining the development of
impactful, evidence-based EMS quality measures.

### History of EMS Quality Measure Development

The structured development of EMS quality measures began with the EMS
Compass Project, an initiative funded by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration (NHTSA) and led by the National Association of
State EMS Officials (NASEMSO) to establish relevant performance measures
for EMS agencies. Since then, the field has advanced under the guidance
of NEMSQA, which works to create sustainable, practical, and high-impact
EMS quality measures through a collaborative, scientifically driven
process.

## NEMSQA Measure Set

The National EMS Quality Alliance (NEMSQA) Measure Set includes a
comprehensive list of EMS quality measures that have been developed and
approved for national use. These measures are intended to guide EMS
agencies in collecting data to assess and improve patient care. Below
are the measures approved by the NEMSQA Measure Development Committee
and Board of Trustees as of August 2019. Access to the full technical
specifications for these measures is available on the NEMSQA website
after creating a user profile.
