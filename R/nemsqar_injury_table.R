#' Synthetic Test Data for eInjury Fields in National EMS Information System
#'
#' This dataset provides completely synthetic test data for evaluating injury-related
#' functions in the `nemsqar` package. It includes key variables related to the
#' cause of injury, trauma triage criteria, vehicular risk factors, and height of falls.
#' The dataset is intended to assist users in testing the expected input structure
#' for injury-related measures.
#'
#' Users are encouraged to test these functions with this dataset, but results
#' should not be interpreted as meaningful. Some outputs may be nonsensical,
#' which is expected since this data is only intended to demonstrate the
#' expected structure of input data.
