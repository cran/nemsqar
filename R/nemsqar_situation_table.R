#' Synthetic Test Data for eSituation Fields in National EMS Information System
#'
#' This dataset provides completely synthetic test data for evaluating situation-related
#' functions in the `nemsqar` package. It includes variables related to patient complaints,
#' symptoms, injury status, and provider impressions. The dataset is designed to
#' assist users in testing the expected input structure for situation-related measures.
#'
#' Users are encouraged to test these functions with this dataset, but results
#' should not be interpreted as meaningful. Some outputs may be nonsensical,
#' which is expected since this data is only intended to demonstrate the
#' expected structure of input data.
